# PdfReducer
Creates a new PDF from an existing PDF which often causes it to reduce its size. Requires Adobe Acrobat OLE Automation component (and it must have write capabilities).

Note: Acrobat GUI can sometimes open itself and show a warning or error dialog box. Just press ok and the process will continue (handling the related error).
